# Geojson maps for Citizen Rotation Office

This repository stories different audio maps used in the [http://hmcro.org](Citizen Rotation Office) project. They are saved as .geojson files so that online tools such as [http://geojson.io/](geojson.io) can be used to create and edit the routes using a visual UI.
